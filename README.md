# How-different-is-your-Twitter-network-from-you

Project Description

● Data: Retrieve twitter profiles, tweets and social connections (e.g. followings and followers) using a specific sample of individuals (e.g. entrepreneurs, etc.).


● Sentiment Analytics and Topics: Use pre-trained machine learning algorithms for identifying the sentiment and topics of tweets.

● Characteristics of Users vs. their social network: Find in which aspects (e.g. sentiment, number of followers, etc.) specific users differentiate from their social network users (e.g. followings and followers).

● Machine Learning: Build a simple prediction model in order to automatically predict Twitter accounts that belong to specific groups of people (e.g. entrepreneurs, etc.) based on their network properties.
